I played a lot of games in 2017. A lot of them were very, very good- developers put out a surprising number of memorable single player experiences, which are, [according to EA](https://www.ea.com/news/an-update-on-the-visceral-star-wars-project ), going the way of the dodo in the near future. We also saw a number of new and interesting concepts explored in the multiplayer arena, with For Honor creating an innovative new approach to fighting games, and PUBG taking the world by storm. But which games were _the best_? We will attempt to find out below.

## Assorted Notes and Honorable Mentions

### Blizzard's Fast Food Approach

I took extended stabs at half of Blizzard's 6-product offering this year, playing a whole bunch of **Overwatch**, a week of **Diablo 3**, and probably too much **Heroes of the Storm**. While these games are "fun", they are too engineered to produce the bare minimum amount of it. Diablo 3 is an endless, repepetive quest for The Perfect Roll, and Heroes and Overwatch consistently feel like they are too difficult to create an impact in. They are also remarkably unejoyable when you're on the losing end of a stomp. Blizzard's matchmaking also has demonstrated that they lack a cohesive company-wide vision, as Overwatch and Heroes have simultaneously taken opposite approaches to performance-based matchmaking.

### Nintendo Is Almost There

The Switch had a pretty remarkable first year, but a lot of their titles missed the mark for me. **Splatoon 2** is a wonderful and logical extension to the first game, and the onslaught of free content is a rarity these days. Unfortunately, their refusal to implement any sort of party system makes this game really hard to play with friends and rather lonely to play by yourself. **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** is a great evolution of the Zelda formula, but I found the experience fairly shallow. The shrines littering the map are fun snack-sized experiences, but the game's main "dungeons" are kind of a shame.

### Playing Catch Up

I did play a few games released before this year that are worth mentioning. I picked up both **Steep** and **HITMAN** in the middle of year on Steam sales, and started playing through the first two **Danganronpa** games in November. These are all vastly different titles which don't fit together whatsoever! But they're all worth picking up at discounted prices.

## Cheap Thrills

**Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands** is an awful game. It is the purest, rawest distillation of American imperialism and military culture, as you and three friends rampage through the Bolivian countryside, taking down the Mexican cartel (???) who has managed to take over the country. It is also far, far more fun than it has any right to be! It is evidence that everything is better with friends, as what would have been a completely lackluster Ubisoft Experience is given new life in a co-operative experience. Execute _actual drone strikes_ on unsuspecting combatants. Send your friends flying to their death as you try to motorcycle down mountains and then resurrect them with your medical drones afterwards.  And absolutely parachute out of a cockpit as one of your friends is making a drink.

**The Evil Within 2**

## Great Experiences

**PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS**

**Resident Evil 7: Biohazard**

**Yakuza 0**

## All-Timers

**Cuphead**

**Nier: Automata**

**Persona 5**

**Super Mario Odyssey** might just be the best game I've played since Super Mario 64.
