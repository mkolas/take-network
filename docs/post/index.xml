      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the month of December I participated in an advent calendar game called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;. Each December from the 1st to the 25th, a new programming puzzle is dished out at 12:00AM EST for you to solve. There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a metagame involved where competitive programmers try to race to get to solutions as fast as possible, but it&amp;rsquo;s still totally fun and a worthwhile set of programming exercises even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the stamina to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; programming at midnight. I&amp;rsquo;ve catalogued a few things I learned over the month in the post below.

      <description>I played a lot of games in 2017. A lot of them were very, very good- developers put out a surprising number of memorable single player experiences, which are, according to EA, going the way of the dodo in the near future. We also saw a number of new and interesting concepts explored in the multiplayer arena, with For Honor creating an innovative new approach to fighting games, and PUBG taking the world by storm.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Take Network is now a real, live network where you will presumably be able to ingest takes. I can think of no better way to christen such a momentous occasion than with a recap of how I got this all online.
